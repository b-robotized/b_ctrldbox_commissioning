# System Overview

This system provides a seamless and robust bridge between the high-level **ROS 2** robotics ecosystem and the real-time, deterministic world of **industrial automation**.

By leveraging the **Bosch Rexroth ctrlX AUTOMATION** platform, developers can use powerful ROS 2 tools like MoveIt2 and RViz to control industrial robots which require certified, low-latency communication, combining the best of both worlds for your robotics applications.

![system architecture](resources/architecture.png)

The architecture is composed of three main parts: the ROS 2 development environment, the ctrlX CORE industrial controller which acts as a real-time bridge, and the physical industrial robot.

### 1. The Commissioning PC (ROS 2)

This is a standard PC where robotics application development takes place.

* **Operating System:** Runs **ROS 2** (e.g., Jazzy Jellyfish).
* **High-Level Tools:** Developers can use the full suite of ROS 2 packages for advanced tasks, such as:
    * **MoveIt2** for motion planning.
    * **RViz** for 3D visualization and diagnostics.
    * **Custom ROS 2 Nodes** for application-specific logic.
* **Communication:** The PC communicates with the ctrlX CORE via ethernet over a standard **ROS 2 DDS network**.

### 2. The Industrial Bridge (ctrlX CORE)

At the heart of the system is the **ctrlX CORE**, an industrial-grade controller that reliably executes real-time tasks.

* **ctrlX OS:** A Linux-based operating system that allows for the deployment of applications as **Snaps**.

* **ctrlX Data Layer:** A real-time, shared-memory database that acts as the central nervous system for all apps running on the device. It allows different processes to exchange data with deterministic speed.

* **Control Bundle (Snap):** This is our custom application package. It embeds a standard **`ros2_control` controller manager** onto the ctrlX CORE. Its role is to receive high-level commands from the ROS 2 network and dispatch them to **controllers or hardware drivers**

* **Real-Time Hardware Interface:** Inside our bundle, a specialized `ros2_control` hardware driver reads commands from the controller manager and writes them directly into the **ctrlX Data Layer**.

* **Industrial Protocol Apps:** The ctrlX CORE simultaneously runs other certified apps, such as an **EtherCAT Master** or **OPC UA Server**. These apps read data from the Data Layer and manage the low-level, physical communication with the robot.

### 3. The Robot

This is an industrial robot that supports a **real-time streaming interface**.

* **Communication:** The robot is connected to the ctrlX CORE using an industrial fieldbus protocol like **EtherCAT**, **UDP/IP**, or **CANopen**.

* **Execution:** It receives a continuous stream of commands from the ctrlX CORE at a high frequency, ensuring smooth motion.

## How It Works: A Typical Data Flow

Here is the step-by-step journey of a command from your computer to the robot's movement:

1.  **Command Generation:** On the development PC, a tool like MoveIt2 or a custom node publishes a command to a ROS 2 topic.
2.  **Network Transmission:** The command travels over the ROS 2 DDS network to our **Control Bundle** running on the ctrlX CORE.
3.  **Controller Management:** The `ros2_control` controller manager inside the bundle receives the command and forwards it to the appropriate controller
4.  **Data Layer Write:** Our custom hardware interface transports the command (e.g., target joint positions) into the **ctrlX Data Layer** in a real-time-safe context.
5.  **Real-Time Read & Stream:** The **EtherCAT Master** app, running in a deterministic loop, reads these values from the Data Layer.
6.  **Robot Movement:** The EtherCAT Master streams the commands over the physical bus to the robot, which executes the motion precisely. The robot's feedback (actual position, velocity) travels back through the same path.

### Why This Architecture?

This architecture is powerful because it solves a fundamental challenge in modern robotics: combining the rapid innovation of open-source software with the stringent real-time and safety requirements of industrial hardware.

Historically, robotics developers had to choose between the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** and **Industrial PLC Systems**. Each has a distinct set of strengths and weaknesses.

Our hybrid approach allows you to **innovate rapidly** using the vast ROS ecosystem while deploying solutions on **certified, industry-proven hardware**. You get the advanced capabilities of modern robotics without sacrificing the performance and safety that industrial applications demand.

| **Programming** | Uses C++ and Python, providing access to a vast pool of developers and a massive ecosystem of open-source libraries.   | Uses IEC 61131-3 (e.g., Ladder Logic), which is optimized for simple, sequential logic control.                        |
| **Typical Weakness** | Lacks native real-time guarantees, industrial-grade safety certifications, and straightforward deployment pipelines.   | Limited in handling complex scientific data, often involves proprietary interfaces and potential vendor lock-in.         |
